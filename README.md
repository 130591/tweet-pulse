TweetPulse is an open source, real‑time tweet analytics platform. It provides everything you need to ingest, enrich, analyze and visualize public tweets end‑to‑end for educational and learning purposes.

- **Product analytics**: ingestion pipeline with enrichment, deduplication, batching and storage.
- **Web analytics**: API and cache optimized for dashboard reads.
- **Real-time stream**: Redis Streams for fan‑out and WebSocket updates.
- **Sentiment/NLP**: pluggable enrichment layer with Lite option.
- **Developer experience**: simulator to develop without hitting Twitter API.

## Getting started

Choose one of the options below:

- **Lite Mode (recommended for laptops):**
  - Guide: docs/LITE_VERSION.md
  - Run: `./scripts/run-lite.sh up`

- **Full stack with Docker Compose:**
  - Requirements: Docker + Docker Compose
  - Run backend: `docker-compose up app db redis`

## 🌊 Pulse CLI (Recommended)

**NEW:** Control your entire TweetPulse environment with an interactive CLI!

```bash
# Interactive mode - choose what to run
python3 pulse.py

# Or use direct commands
python3 pulse.py dev all        # Run everything
python3 pulse.py dev frontend   # Run only frontend
python3 pulse.py dev api        # Run backend + workers
python3 pulse.py status         # Check status
python3 pulse.py logs -f        # Follow logs
python3 pulse.py stop           # Stop everything
```

**Quick setup:**
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements-cli.txt
python3 pulse.py
```

📖 See [QUICK_START.md](QUICK_START.md) or [CLI_README.md](CLI_README.md) for full documentation.

## Local development

- **With Pulse CLI (recommended):** `python3 pulse.py dev all`
- Backend dev server: `docker-compose up app`
- Worker: `docker-compose up worker`
- Environment: configure `.env` (see `docker-compose.yml` for variables)

## Stream simulator

Develop without the Twitter API using the built‑in simulator:

- Quick start: `python scripts/simulator/simulate_tweet_stream.py --speed medium --loop`
- Docs: `scripts/simulator/QUICK_START_SIMULATOR.md`
- Dataset: `data/fake_tweets_dataset.json`

## Why TweetPulse?

- Educational end‑to‑end reference of a real‑time data pipeline
- Clear architecture, modular ingestion, and production‑style patterns
- Works fully locally; simulator removes external API constraints

## Contributing

- Issues and feature requests: https://github.com/130591/tweetpulse/issues
